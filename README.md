The prior version of _vxWeb_ is a simple CMS which both provided server- and client-site functionality. 
This client is a [Vue](https://vuejs.org) SPA which works with a separate _vxWeb Server_ application via a REST API.
Styling is handled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com), authentication is handled with a JWT.
